# 🌍 World Happiness Report 2024 – Global Insights Dashboard

This is a data visualization project built in Tableau based on the 2024 edition of the World Happiness Report. The dashboard allows users to explore happiness metrics and related factors across more than 130 countries through interactive maps, charts, and storytelling.

## 📊 Project Overview

The dashboard includes multiple sections that highlight the relationships between happiness and key variables such as:

- GDP per capita
- Healthy life expectancy
- Social support
- Freedom to make life choices
- Generosity
- Perceptions of corruption

Users can interact with filters, tooltips, and navigation buttons to explore insights across regions and years.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Finland, Denmark, and Iceland are the top three happiest countries in 2024.
- The strongest correlations with happiness are GDP, social support, and health.
